            <li>Personal background: I was born in WV, but moved to Charlotte when I was 5. My freshman year I went to
                NC State for engineering,
                but I ended up transfering to UNCC to be closer to home after a hospital scare. From there I changed my
                major to Computer Science and I have
                been here ever since</li>
            <li>Professional: I started working part time when I turned 15 and I've had several retail jobs. More
                recently I have been a Teaching Assistant for this course in the Spring of last year. In addition to
                being a
                TA, this summer I was also a university research assistant.
            </li>
            <li>Academic background: I graduated high school at Olympic High School here in Charlotte and this past
                Spring I graduated
                with my Bachelors in Computer Science with a concentration in web and mobile app development and a minor
                in psychology.
            </li>
            <li>Background in the subject matter of this course: I have my Bachelors in Computer Science with a
                concentration in Web and Mobile app development. In
                addition to this I am currently getting my Masters in Information Technology.
            </li>
            <li>Primary Computer Platform: Windows 10</li>

                </ul>

            <li>Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you by:
                In my free time I work with my Beagle named Dwight to teach him alternative communication through
                buttons, like people see on tik tok. So far he is pretty fluent
                with the words: outside, potty, play, want, now, later, help, love you, and all done</li>
            <li>I'd also like to share:
                I hope to graduate this upcoming Spring </li>
        </ul>
