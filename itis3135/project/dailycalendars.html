                            <p style="color: #c46500">Our students can start coming into the room at 8:00,
                                but the tardy bell does not ring until 8:15.
                                After they get their things put away for the day,
                                they complete their quick Morning Work review, then
                                they head to their Morning Tub.  (Read more about Morning
                                Tubs here.)  I ring the bell at 8:30 to clean up.
                                We go over our Morning Work together.  Then, my students
                                head over to the carpet for Morning Meeting and Calendar.</p>

                            <p style="color: #c46500">We start by singing our welcome song.
                                Then, I have the students share a very quick tidbit
                                about their night if they have anything they want to tell us.
                                Afterwards, our calendar person of the week changes everything
                                on the calendar.  We say the date, count our days with money,
                                count using the number grid, come up with number sentences, etc.  I write a Morning Message on our easel with mistakes that my students need to correct.  Afterwards, I read our Discussion Question of the Day.  I give each of the students an opportunity to share their ideas.  Finally, I read a picture book to the class.  This picture book read aloud is for pure enjoyment.</p>

                            <p style="color: #c46500">This is our Intervention and Enrichment time for reading.  Being in a non-Title school, we do not have very many extra hands.  We really only have one other teacher that takes a small group of kids (2 kids from each of our five 1st grade classrooms), so our I/E groups are basically a normal class size üôÅ  I work on fluency and comprehension with my kids during this time.</p>

                        <dd class="timeline-event-content" >
                            <p style="color: #c46500">We try to squeeze in a restroom break prior to our reading block.  I start off with whole group reading instruction.  We do use a basal reading series.  I know, I know‚Ä¶many people are very anti-basal.  But, it is what it is, so I make the most of it.  I actually don‚Äôt mind it at all as a guide for instruction.  I follow along with the scope and sequence for phonics, grammar, and comprehension skills.  However, I definitely supplement and add my own flair to it.  After our whole group instruction, we move onto writing.

                                I do not use the writing instruction from our basal series.  I just have never liked it.  I teach writing using mini-lessons.  (Read more about my writing mini-lessons here.)  This way the instruction is explicit and short.  Then, my students have a longer time period to actually spend writing.

                                Next, we do small group reading instruction.  I would LOVE nothing more than to meet with more small groups during this time, but I just haven‚Äôt found a way to make it happen.  Trying to squeeze phonics, grammar, whole group reading, small group reading, and writing all in this time period makes it very difficult.</p>

                            <p style="color: #c46500">I know that I said above that if I could adjust our schedule, the only thing that I would change would be to push back our lunch.  Actually, another thing I would change would be for our students to have a longer lunch and recess.  I just feel like they are so rushed during this time.  We have a duty free lunch, but we have recess duty during this time once a week.</p>

Last year, I started having them free write in their journals during this time, and I like it much better.</p>
